//python notes

dir :tells the attributes related to the object
help: help in getting the informton related to the function 
eg: help(random.randint) 

randint : generates a random number between a and b both a and b inclusive

alt+p : to get the last command executed in the shell

range function has three arguments start , stop and step 

example list(range(5,10,2))

stop is not included , while start is included

lists 
lists are mutable , dynammic and heterogenos in nature

tuple 
when we make a list immutable it becomes tuple

dictionary
an unordered set of key/value pairs
dictionary are mutable
unique keys 

set 
unordered set of unique elements

len(collection_name) to find the length of the collection

collection_name.append('a') to append an element in a collection 

not in operator checks if an object is not present in the collection or sequence

taking input from the user 

word = input("enter your choice")

useful methods of list
len(list) gives the length of the list 
extend: to merge two lists takes a collection as an argument
remove: to remove an object from list takes value as an argument
pop: to remove takes index as an argument 

extend and append insert at one end of the list that is the right hand side 

while insert adds new object to the beginning or at a particular index of the list takes index value as an argument 
eg: num.insert(0,10)
inserting 10 at index no 0

conversion of string to list
list(string)

conversion of list to string
''.join(list)

copy method to copy objects from one list to another deep copy

to get last element of the list list[-1]

slicing in list

list[start:stop:step]
start has default value 0
stop has default value max allowed for the list
step has default value 1
stop is not inclusive
